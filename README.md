# OpenSimulator
Swift script to open the most recently used iOS simulator's documents directory

### Usage

1. Clone repo and put OpenSimulator.swift somewhere
2. Terminal
3. 
```
.../OpenSimulator.swift
```

### How it works

The script looks through the simulator directories, and uses the 'Modification Date' attribute to determine which of the simulators was the most recently used.
